# Green Tea Metabolite 
Green Tea is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. The dried leaf is processed from *Camellia sinensis* plant and it full of amino acids, caffeine, and catechins. This project will analyze the relationship between these organic compounds and use that analysis to make a machine learning model to predict features.

# Organic Compounds
The 8 major Catechins we will be analyzing in this study are Epicatechin (EC), Epicatechin gallate (ECG), Epigallocatechin (EGC), Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), Gallocatechin (GC), Gallocatechin gallate (GCG), Catechin (C), Catechin gallate (CG).
These catechins are effected by many different aspects such as growing, processing, and brewing (Reygaert).

Other organic compounds such as caffeine are also produced in different amounts in each tea plant are are also effected by the same parameters as catechins.
